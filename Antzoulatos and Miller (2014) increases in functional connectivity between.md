# Antzoulatos and Miller (2014) increases in functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and striatum during category learning

## Research Question:
Do PFC and BG functionally interact or is the observed guidance of learning due to the systems running in parallel in isolated loops/learning systems? 
## Approach
The study examined functional connectivity between PFC and STR through LFP synchrony. 426 electrode pairs in BG and PFC. 
## Findings
 - Approximately 20 Hz was the peak frequency for PFC-STR synchrony which is in the beta band. This is consistent with other data of showing beta synchrony between these two regions. 
- There were no changes between pairs of electrodes within either STR or PFC with change in learning. 
- There was a significant decrease in PFC-STR synchrony during error trials as the learners moved from SR learning to category learning. 
- There was more STR-PFC synchrony during error trials than in correct trials in exemplar epochs.
- Category specific networks were detected only after learning and only in PFC-STR synchrony and not within either one of those regions. These networks were detected because certain pairs of electrodes showed category preference. 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Interactions between the BG and PFC might explain category learning as BG-STR learns simple associations rapidly that are organized and knit together with other information by the PFC. _What does this mean for flexibility?_
- Iterations allow the PFC to learn and store common features across patterns learned by the BG. _What?_
- Faster changes in BG than in PFC during learning suggests that the BG trains the PFC as described above. 
- The BG leads learning early in category learning because it predicts learning behavior better than PFC but this is reversed in the late stages of learning. This provides more evidence for the roles of the two regions in category learning described above. 
- Synchrony between regions is thought to establish functional circuitry. 
- Spike-LFP measures show that the STR drives activity in the PFC. 
- Excessive synchrony between BG-PFC could result in PFC not learning associations well. This is observed in Parkinsonism. The results had shown that there was higher synchrony between the two regions during error trials than correct trials. Not sure. …
- Beta band oscillations are prominent in PFC and Gamma in posterior cortex. This is associated with Top-down vs bottom-up processing. 
## Other notes
- The task in this paper involves learning to associate a dot pattern with either left or right movement. Monkeys doing this task learned through BG driven S-R association learning. Then they progressed to acquiring categories with experience. This suggests a shift to using PFC to learn the categories. If it took Monkeys a lot of trials to form the categories would humans, me for example, come-up with a declarative rule to rapidly categorize dot patterns? Would this be only applicable for simple patterns? If more complex patterns were given would be similarly learn this information through BG based SR learning?
