Cognition and Perception Area

Dear GTC members, 

In my time at the department of Psychology I have co-mentored two honors students in my lab, Savannah Cassis (who won the Presidentâ€™s Medal in 2020) and Victor Wu who presented his research at an international conference. I  continue to mentor Jon Jones as part of the Psychology mentoring program and help him navigate the research and graduate school application space. He is also now in the Honors program. I have found mentoring students to be very rewarding and a chance to pay forward all the help and mentorship I have received over the years. 
In addition to mentoring, I have served as a GPAC representative for two years but my most significant contributions to the department come from my participation in 2 Psych Virtual Recruitment events where I represented the cognition and Perception area. I have also presented a rapid-fire talk about my research in the 2021 graduate recruitment event in February. 
Along with my advisor Chantel Prat I have helped in finding early career post-docs and professors from diverse backgrounds to present their work and talk to students at our cog/per area colloquium. 
I am currently in the process of developing my dissertation project. It would be helpful to get some relief from TA and RA duties to make progress on my project. 

Thank you.
