# Kahneman 2009 Conditions for intuitive expertise


## premise
- what are the differences between the two seemingly conflicting views of expertise - heuristics and biases, and naturalistic decision making?
- what are the activities in which skilled intuitive judgement develops with experience?
- When does experience develop over confidence than genuine skill?

## points of view
### Kahneman
- supports the heuristics and biases point of view
- intuitive judgement is often found to be flawed. 
- A preference should be made for formal, logical, statistical reasoning. 
- judgement is measured agains models and clear metrics
- observes experts in controlled situations
### Gary Klein
- supports the naturalistic decision making point of  view.
- According to NDM, intuition is the recognition of patterns stored in memory. 
- The central goal to NDM is to find cues that skilled workers use to make decisions implicitly, they use cognitive task analysis. 
- judgement is measured against others of similar skill. 
- observes experts in naturalistic situations. 
- observes constant tasks with novel problems. 


Sometimes, markers that point towards a specific category overlap with other categories. Meaning, they are non specific. Usually, also, there may be many more indicators for a category than the decision maker is aware of. This can only be learned through further experience. These skills seem to be very implicit. How stable these markers are also determines how well the associations are learned. So depending on the situation, expert judgement can be accurate or wrong.  An additional drawback of expert performance or being highly attuned to the features of a category is that you trade speed and reliability for flexibility. 



Simply read the conclusions. 
This paper evaluates situations where expert performance is reliable, can develop and simply leads to overconfidence that could be not relied up on.
