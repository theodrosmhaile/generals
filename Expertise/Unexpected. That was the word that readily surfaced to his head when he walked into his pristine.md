Unexpected. That was the word that readily surfaced to his head when he walked into his pristine bedroom, exhausted. Nothing in his life had prepared him for the events of the day. He had left for work at 8 am, as usual. The ride on the bus was predictable. Expectedly so. It was noisy, there were too many people who looked tired and no one made eye contact. That was the world he lived in. But he did not expect to recognize all of the people on the bus. And that was how it started. The guy in the blue beanie with the coffee, sitting 3 rows ahead of him, he knew him. The young girl sitting quietly with her eyes closed, he knew her too. More than just their familiarity he knew they would be on the bus at that time. He hadnâ€™t the faintest idea how he was calm about it all. The usual panic did not constrict his chest and he did not feel the need to cradle his head or repeat the mantra to quiet his errant feelings. That was unexpected in itself but he remembered having the thought to play a game. Why waste this cloud-free moment. At each of the stops he tried to bring into mind the people who would step onto the bus. It was like trying to remember a list he had memorized, or recall the next set of verses in the songs he listened to. It had worked. He knew all of them, the clothes they had chosen to wear and where they would sit on the bus. This had baffled him enormously but, it was even more baffling that something in his reality had shifted in this specific manner.
