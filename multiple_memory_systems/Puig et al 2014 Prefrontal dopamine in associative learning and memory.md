# Puig et al 2014 Prefrontal dopamine in associative learning and memory


## Research Question
What is the role of DA signals in prefrontal cortex during associative learning?
## Approach
This is a review of studies that look at fronto-striatal interaction during learning and the effect of DA transmission. The studies use non-human primates and simultaneous, multi-site electrophysiological recordings.
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
Learning in the PFC-BG links involves at least three loops: excutive loop that involves the PFC (and putamen) which is heavily involved during learning, motor loop that involves the motor and pre-motor cortex, which are responsible for performance after learning and the final loop that connects the ventral striatum with limbic areas like the hippocampus, amygdala, OFC etc, called the motivational loop processes reward outcome. 
Learning is dependent not only on the executive loop that learns the associations but also on the montivational loop that processes reward outcomes which is heavily mediated by the **Amygdala**. 
In a reversal study, where stimulus response associations are reversed, the caudate nucleus of the striatum attains or codes the reversal before PFC does. The PFC catches up after several trials. This aligns with previous knowledge that the striatum more rapidly learns associations than the PFC which requires more experience to be updated. This is not the whole story however, generalizing catgory membership, after training, of novel stimuli is better learned or integrated by the PFC and not the caudate nucleus. The caudate nucleus is better, as stated above, at acquiring associations which inform the pfc. This aligns with earlier Miller papers that show that formations of higher categories are more likely performed or organized by the pfc from rapidly learned associations in the basal ganglia. 
Impairment of D1R and D2R receptors in PFC impairs formatation of new associations and cognitive flexibility but not previously learned associations. This suggests that DA signals in pfc are responsible initiating and facilitating acquisition of new associations or categories by pfc. This aligns with the shift of expert performance to the sensorimotor loop between motor cortex and BG once the performance has become a habit.
