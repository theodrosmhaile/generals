# Poldrack et al 2001 Interactive memory systems in the human brain

## Research Question:

## Approach
Used fMRI to compare the two versions of the weather prediction task : the feedback based and paired association versions. 
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Paired association learning is thought to engage declarative memory
- Feedback based association utilized declarative learning mechanisms in the beginning and likely shifted to non-declarative learning mechanisms later on with further experience. 
- FB was driven by activity in the basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus BUT there was also widespread activity in cortex. Confusingly, there was reduced activity in medial PFC, parietal cortex and auditory cortex. There was also a decrease of activity in MTL. 
- There is a negative relationship between MTL and the caudate nucleus across participants; I.e. across the two different tasks, FB vs PA. 
- In a trial by trial scan of FB learning in Experiment 2, there was an activation of MTL in the beginning of learning that quickly dissipated with an increase in activity of BG/Caudate nucleus. The MTL was deactivated through out the task. 
- Involvement of MTL early learning probably facilitates learning in later trials by BG. Earlier studies with MTL lesioned patients have shown impairment in learning. But so have studies with BG disorders. 
- There might be a slight discrepancy here: Miller claimed that associations are learned first and quickly by BG and organized by PFC for more abstracted or complex skills. Here, BG activity precedes PFC. Anderson and others, plus the current paper make the case for declarative-first learning that is probably driven by MTL (at least in the case of Anderson et al). Does this then complete a larger picture of learning where MTL driven declarative learning precedes all other systems? Then does BG learn associations that then might be strengthened and organized and monitored by PFC? Does PFC mediate activity between the other two regions? What is the effect of BG on MTL? What is the effect of PFC on MTL? Does the MTL have reciprocating effect on the other two systems? From Poldrack et al.’s discussion that MTL might be important for early learning suggests that MTL affects activity in BG and PFC perhaps directly through separate streams of information or through a modulatory connection either through BG or PFC. 
- Reber et al study finding of WPT being learned by BG with patients with MTL lesions who could not use this information flexibly sits well with the assumptions that BG learned ‘habits’ are inflexible and declarative information can be interpreted and modified by MTL-PFC (may be) domain general systems and used in other similar tasks. 
- **This is a very important point: The two systems might engage in learning different types of associations. BG tend to learn inflexible associations while MTL learns more flexible and place related items. But conceivably, either of the systems could be used to learn at every stage of training as shown by more lesion studies. The two systems compete. Does collins say that the two systems interact?  WHAT DETERMINES WHICH SYSTEM IS USED IN HEALTHY LEARNERS??? Perhaps other bottle necks like WM capacity determine which system is used? ID in RL?**
