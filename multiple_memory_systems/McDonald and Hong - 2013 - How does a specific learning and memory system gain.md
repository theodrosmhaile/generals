## summary and how does it connect

- HOw do learning and memmory systems gain control of behavior?
- Mulitple regions - hippocampus, dorsal striatum, rhinal cortex - are involved. 
- How these systems interact and gain control of behavior is determined by the current environmental demands, shaping by the experience of the organism with the environment, and genetics. 
- The **hippocampus** stores combined rich sensory and episodic information. This is necessary to guide behavior. Rats with damaged HIP do not navigate a maze as well as intact mice. 
- **Amygdala** stores associations of stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes. Because of its influence on the brain stem, hypothalamus and basal forebrain it can elicit apporach or avoice behavior. Rats with damage to the amygdala are unable to be conditioned to avoid a shock when a neutral cue is presented. 
- **Dorso-lateral striatum** learns instrumental conditioning or motor responses to stimuli. Rats with lesions in DLS do not learn to press a lever when a light is shown and pull a chain when a sound is presented.
- These multiple learning and memory systems interact depending on the situation or environmental demands. 
	- Some tasks might only require learning to navigate a space only probably only using hippocampus. 
	- A second set of tasks might be learned by hippocampus and dorsal striatum because in addition to the space, another cue like sound or light might be added for instrumental learning. 
	- A third set might combine the above 2 with amygdala learning that provides fear or reward information. 
	- Depending on context, these memory systems might inhibit eachother restricting or enabling access to behavior. For example, mice that have been habituated to a space learn to inhibit the amygdala even when the space has changed. This inhibition requires longer experience with the new situation to be turned off. Mice who are not habituated have less hippocampal inhibition on the amygdala; those with lesions in the ventral hippocampus also do not have effective inhibition of the amygdala resulting in more rapid fear response. 
- The hippocampus acquires information in parallel with the dorso-lateral striatum and amygdala. There is evidence that the hippocampus, if present, inhibits the other regions and acquries that information; in some cases, these systems compete for behavioral control. 
	- Alternatively, it could be that other systems are not occluded from learning but are prevented from reaching output nodes. 
	- Hippocampus may also have a much faster learning rate which allows it to dominate in fast learning short term situations but longer training is supported by the other learning regions which could guide behavior even in the absence of the hippocampus
	- There is evidence that shows that these learning systems are independent: if the hippocampus is removed before acquisition there is not a deficit of learning by other systems because they are not part of a plasticity circuit that will be removed.
### Effects of external factors on selection of memmory system to control behavior.
Learning will likely progress from the hippocampal-amygdala-nucleus-accumbens facilitated fast learning to the efficient habit learning mediated by the dorsolateral striatum. Now if the stimulus-response maps are reversed in this environment, and previous responses no longer produce a reward, the earlier hippocampus + learning systems would need to be re-engaged and the dorso-lateral striatum would need to be interrupted. The preforntal cortex likely will run this intervention through executive decision. 

### Individual differences in learning: traits differences 
- Rats with damage to the hippocampus chose a visible platform in a water maze over a submerged platform that was pre-learned. Rats with damage to the dorsolateral striatum chose the platform in the original location. But most importantly, * controls were split in this decision*. The rats that chose the original location were better place learners during training. This is possibly due to genetic and environmental effects, currently and during development (pre and post-natally) and accumulated experience. These traits differences could result in enhanced or inhibited plasticity in on learning and memory network compared to another. Additionally, differences in prefrontal cortex control and weighting of the multiple memory systems might result in the different regions controlling behavior in different individuals. ** Read McDonald et al., 2004, Colombo et al.2003; Brightwell et al., 2008; Baudonnat et al., 2011**
- Note that increased levels of acetylcholine, even before training, in either hippocampus or striatum resulted in place learning and response learning respectively. 
- The prefrontal system might enable switching between memory systems depending on context and experience because it recieves inputs from all of these learning systems, making reflective decisions. This is opposed to decisions that arise, or dominance of specific learning systems in sites of convergence like the nucleus accumbens. This is not the last word on interactions of systems.
