# Keren and Schul 2009: A critical evaluation of two-system theories
## Research Question:
How successful is the two-system theory/model of the human mind?
## Approach
This is a review paper. 
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Two system theories are not clearly defined and rigorously tested
- Keren et al’s system 1 is akin to autonomous procedural system/skills while system 2 is like controlled processing or largely declarative, effortful skill. But from their descriptions of an example involving a hypothetical person the distinction is different. This is a little far removed from the neuroscience and cognition characterizations of the two systems but I suspect some of the same neural structures  are involved (they would have to be) with the addition of more conflict resolution (ACC), decision making (OFC),and emotional processing (Amygdala and others) units. 
- The authors state that the hot vs cold dichotomy that exists in the many dual-system theories is notable. I wonder if the effects of emotionally charged situations simply affect cognition in a way that habits and heuristics are simply more un-inhibited because of the activity dampening effect of heightened emotions on decision making systems in the PFC and related critical thinking networks. Again, I happen to be wrong? The authors dismiss this for reasons I have not yet captured. 
- Are the systems dichotomous? What are the possibilities that we can have systems that could take some attributes from both sides of the dichotomies at the same time?
- Are the two systems isolable? 

### Highlights
Yellow - points to note/important 
Red - questions/discrepancies/disagree/don’t understand
Green - connects well with other recognized
