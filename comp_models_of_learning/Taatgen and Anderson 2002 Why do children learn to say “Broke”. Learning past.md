# Taatgen and Anderson 2002 Why do children learn to say “Broke”. Learning past tense without feedback

## Research Question:
How do children learn to the past tense, essentially, without feedback? How can we explain the U-shaped trajectory of past-tense learning. 
## Approach
An ACT-R model model that uses 4 strategies: zero strategy that produces nothing,a retrieval strategy that retrieves a relevant example and tries to build a past-tense, an analogy strategy that retrieves an arbitraty example and tries to extrapolate an answer analogically, and a later learned strategy called regular rule which is the development of a rule after sufficient experience with the analogy. This model does not receive feedback. It starts out with the retriveal and zero strategies, the first of which produces correcet irregular past-tense verbs, which makes up the first stage or the left arm of the ‘U’ shaped curve. Once the model starts making rules it will likely over apply the rule leading to more errors and the base of the ‘U’ curve. With more experience the rule is refined which results in stage-3 or the 2nd arm of the ‘U’ curve.
