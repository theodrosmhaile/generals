# Marewski and Schooler 2011 Cognitive Niches: an ecological model of strategy selection
## Research Question:
What is the process of strategy selection?
## Approach
Used a series of experiments and an ACT-R model to solve the strategy selection puzzle. A model uses the interactions between the strategies, cognitive capacities like memory and the environment to understand strategy selection. The strategies compared are the *Accessibility-based* recogntion heuristic and Fluency heuristic, the *knowledge-based* Tally1, Tally2, and Take-the-best strategies, and other knowledge-based strategies that are sampled as a function of strategy— Take-the-first-cue, which samples cues according to how fast the are retrieved, Take-the-first-value1, which relies on sampling cue values independently for each item, and Take-the-first-value2 which relies on either A or B has a positive cue or negative cue respectively. These are built as production rules. 
The ACT-R model integrates memory and time perception like how often an object or stimulus appears in the environment.

## summary and how does it connect
**Cognitive Niche** defines the set of available and usable strategies that are determined by cognitive capacities and the strategy that is afforded by the current environment and time. Note that this also states that an agent or organism will not search all the strategies it knows to apply to a certain situation. The interaction between the environment and cognitive capacities limits the strategy search space.
In strategy selection, if the niches overlap for multiple strategies a cost-benefit (fast vs  accurate response) and learning analysis is used to select a strategy. 

The accessiblity of memories affect decisions: Recogniton; familiarity; fluency or availability which denotes the ease of recall. A strategy that is solely based on accessibility is called **fluency Heuristic**.

In the ACT-R model, recognition or availability of memory for a specific item is determined by if and how fast a chunk is retrieved - this works well with the recognition heuristic and fluency heuristics. Meaning, if both chunks are retrieved the chunk that was retrieved the fastest will win out in affecting decision.
