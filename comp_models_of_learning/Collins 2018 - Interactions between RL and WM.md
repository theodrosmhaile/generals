## Limitations
Collins 2018 aligns with other studies on multiple memory systems but it mis-characterizes short-term memory, information held for a short time, but held longer than working memory. Their models have shown that reliance on working memory reduces the activity of the more robust RL system.  This agrees with the flexible vs durable competition for memory systems that utilize learning for survival in the real world, but ignores that some of what they attribute to RL might be persistent short-term memory that might hold associations long enough to be stable after the 10 minute delay before the surprise test. 
How will the choice in learning mechanism change if learners were aware that a test was upcoming? Utilizing working memory for the short 3-image blocks makes logical sense — a learner does not need to laboriously learn associations if they believe they are not needed past the small time frame of the block. But if they knew that they were going to be tested, learners will try to learn associations in a more stable manner. The antithesis of this does not automatically mean basal-ganglia-based reinforcement learning regardless of what their models say. Consider that several other studies describe the first stage of skill learning to be declarative in nature (Anderson; Tenison). It is more probable that learners will attempt to commit the associations to declarative long-term memory as facts. These could be later retrieved to working memory and used when needed in post-break test. This is not to say that other learners will not engage in RL.
