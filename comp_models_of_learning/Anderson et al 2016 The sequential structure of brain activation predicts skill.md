# Anderson et al 2016  The sequential structure of brain activation predicts skill

## Research Question:
What are the dynamic brain activation patterns that predict the sequential development of skill?
## Approach
- This is an individual differences analysis of an fMRI study while learners play the space fortress game. Additionally, an ACT-R model, that operates within the limits of human cognition and perception, was used to model performance. 
- Whole brain scans were used instead of specific brain regions. fMRI was collected in two sessions the first in session 2 of 10 learning and scan sessions and the second in the last learning session across 5 days.
## Findings
 - The study did not find any regions that differentiated good learners from bad learners. 
- Mean activity of the right dorsal striatum, involving the caudate and claustrum, correlated with player average score
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- As skill develops there is a proportional drop-out in signal in fMRI in specific regions. 
- In perceptual skills there is often an increase in signal in the fusiform area for the object/modality in that skill.
- Participants were fit to act-r models that seemed like were the most perfect performers. The best performers fit the act-r models best because the models were very high-performing; but the high performers were also working through the game in similar ways to the act-r models. They were able to predict the score of the participant from the sequence of actions/states they went into during play. 
- Brain activation during task were connected, using a classifier, with the state sequences. Now, they showed that the state sequence predicted by brain activation can predict performance.
