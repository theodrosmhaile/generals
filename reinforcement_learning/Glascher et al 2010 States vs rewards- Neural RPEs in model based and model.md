# Glascher et al 2010 States vs rewards: Neural RPEs in model based and model free RL

## Research Question:
What are the different learning properties of model-based and model free RL? Does the human brain compute both RPEs and SPEs? If yes, what are the different neural signals of these two?
## Approach
fMRI and model characterization of a probabilistic Markov decision task.
## Findings
 Our findings
suggest that the two different types of learning signal are at least
partly anatomically dissociable in the brain
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- **Model-free**: RPEs are used to learn which actions and choices are valuable.
- **Model-Based**: S[tate] PEs are used to learn which states are currently expected given the previous states experienced.  

### Highlights
Yellow - points to note/important 
Red - questions/discrepancies/disagree/donâ€™t understand
Green - connects well with other recognized
