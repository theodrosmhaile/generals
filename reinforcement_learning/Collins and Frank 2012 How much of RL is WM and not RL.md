# Collins and Frank 2012 How much of RL is WM and not RL?

## Research Question:
What are the contributions of WM and RL to simple instrumental learning?  Can we isolate these contributions using hybrid models?
## Approach
- cognitive models: RL and WM hybrid model
- Simple association learning tasks
- verification of model estimates with genetic markers of prefrontal WM and RL
## Findings
 - The effect of delay on performance decreased with more training. 
- As set sizes increased learners likely relied on reinforcement learning. *Why? Why not use RL to begin with? It is likely that some learners shift to RL early on or use declarative memory enhancing strategies like creating meaning to remember the associations.  How is the BG connected to hippocampus and declarative information learning? According to Miller rules are learned by PFC for categorizing stimuli which is declarative learning?*
- Does BG RL train declarative memory learning? 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Attentional lapses?
- The RLWM model seems very similar to dual-processing models -  controlled or WM declarative vs automated proceduralized system. This model reflects only the wm component of behavior that is capacity limited and fades but in actuality this processing mode utilizes various memory and control units - episodic buffers, declarative memory attentional and conflict resolution units. Yes, items from working memory fade but associations could be recalled, re-constructed from declarative rules etc, which is not represented here. Yes, RL-based learning is perhaps the opposite mechanism to the “WM” system but proceduralization heavily involves VTA-BG-PFC network learning to proceduralize behavior in a robust way. This system is driven by dopamine learning from VTA which takes the shape of RL learning. 
- I guess the purpose of this study was not really to find a unified model of learning that builds on older theories and models of learning; it does seem like the main goal of this project was to capture the wm component of the learning system using or at a simple task level. This makes sense, since perhaps working memory is a major bottle neck but the two features, capacity limitation and quick decay, can be superseded by memory strategies. How much of that is accounted for by the RL portion or is variance still unexplained in fitting this task? Would memory strategies resemble RL learning trajectories?
- The RL-BG and WM-PFC separation seems unrealistic… BG + PFC network is more likely how associations are learned rather than BG alone….[red highlight]
