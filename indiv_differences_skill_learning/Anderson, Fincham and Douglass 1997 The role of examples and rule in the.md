# Anderson, Fincham and Douglass 1997 The role of examples and rule in the acquisition of a cognitive skill. 

## Research Question:
Does learning of cognitive skill progress from reliance on examples to abstract rules or vice versa?
## Approach
 A series of experiments were designed to test this. 
The study depended on the  latency and sel-reports to gague which strategy learners were using. 
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- In ACT-R development of knowledge or skill is abstracted from declarative memory or external records of concrete examples. Once the knowledge is abstracted or proceduralized, recall or review of the examples are no longer necessary.
- Learners could use one of four strategies when dealing with novel problems of a learned type:
	- **Analogy**: Use an analogical exrtapolation of the example and apply it; this is slow. 
	- ** Declarative rule**: learners concsiously identify the rule after several trials and apply it. This is faster than the first method. 
	- ** Production rule**: after a lof of practice, learners have abstracted and “embodied” the rule which they then apply to the trial. This very efficient and does not rely on declarative recall.  
	- **recall of answer** this is the fastest option because problems don;t need to be worked out. If it is an item that has been previously seen, learners simply report the answer. 
- Learners could use the strategies above in some mixture of sequences which changes overtime. It is highly unlikely that learners use a single learning mechanism to learn skills
