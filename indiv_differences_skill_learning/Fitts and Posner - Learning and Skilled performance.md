## Approach
This is a book chapter
## Findings
### introduction
 - Interesting that morse code was termed “telegraphic language”. We now have similar ideas about learning to code as programming language (pg8).
- note about the link between symbolic processes and and perceptual-motor processes. 
- progression through stages of skill during learning is continuous and not punctuated by plateaus as the original study of the telegraphic language by Bryan and Harter have said. 
- Hierarchy operations: 
	- operations for grouping items in to categories
	- operations for defining restrictive relationships for position, order sequence etc between categories
	- Examples include language (grammar organizes)
- Sequence operations  motor sequences like golf (wrist and finger movements follow and are affected by, in successful swings, larger initiated movements like body rotations and arm. 
- A computer analogy: there are automatic, motor sequence subroutines that may be flexibly deployed when needed for various tasks. These subroutines are under the control of an executive control and decision framework. This is also an example of hierarchical organization : one or few large, general executive systems that control many specialized, automatic subroutines. 
### Learning phases
There are 3 learning phases; the transitions between the phases is indistinct and gradual. These are 1) Early or Cognitive phase; 2) intermediate or associative phase; 3) Final or autonomous phase
1. *Early or cognitive phase*: Behavior is a patchwork of old habits (subroutines) ready to be combined to form new skills. It is usually necessary to attend to cues, events and responses: paying attention to kinesthetic information from your feet when learning to dance. 
2. *intermediate or associative phase*: New patterns made up of individual units or subroutines are tried out and new routines are also generated. Inappropriate subroutines or errors or responses to the wrong cues are gradually eliminated though they might be more frequent at first. Components of complex skills may be practiced in isolation or in concert if the skill requires integration of the components for performance.
3.  *Final or Autonomous phase*: components or subroutines become increasingly autonomous during this phase and need less supervision or control by executive processes. You can walk and talk…
	 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Very similar conception of what it means to transition between stages in skill learning to Tenison and Anderson and also to Anderson’s idea of hierarchical skill organization. This is not surprising as F&P67 was cited in T&A paper. 
- A very useful connect would be to understand which fundamental learning mechanisms are used in large predominantly, if ever, in each of the phases. WM and attention need to be utilized most in the first phase and the second phase and to a less degree or with fewer demands in the third phase. 
- What constitutes habit learning? Which mechanisms or brain regions support autonomous skill performance? This has to be a combination of RL and declarative and episodic memory. This must vary depending on the type of task but also its complexity. 
- what’s the differences between procedural learning and RL? Procedural learning has lots of motor sequences? How does this connect to cognitive skills?
- Prior learning/habits/skills are applied in new situations. New skills are built upon these prior skills. 
	- _initial learning_ involves calling up previous points of view, strategies and specific applicable skills. Instructions aid in this early part of learning. 
		- What are the effects of Individual differences? 
	- _intermediate learning stage_ helps weed out those subroutines or components of previous skill that are not helpful for the current task even while instruction or learning in the earlier stage might activate these sub skills. 
		- How would one model this in ACT-R? 
		- What is the cost of trying apply unhelpful subroutines? 
		- What learning mechanisms help in selecting useful ones? 
		- Which strategies? 
	- _negative transfer_ is a situation where previously learned S-R mappings interfere with or impair  the learning of new mappings that are opposite to the previous well trained mappings. _positive transfer_ on the other hand are skill transfers that aid performance in the new skill
