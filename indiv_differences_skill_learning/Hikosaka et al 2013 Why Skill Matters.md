#  Hikosaka et al  2013 Why Skill Matters
## Research Question:
How does skill benefit the learning organism? 
## Approach
This is a review article. It focuses on examining the benefits of speeded performance of skill learning for survival. 
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Skill is necessary because it provides the fastest streamlining of object detection and behavior deployment that results in getting a reward quickly. 
- The most efficient way to get a reward is to reduce the time it takes to identify and categorize the object - object skill. 
- Object skill takes many trials to learn but is durable (long lasting), has a high capacity and is automatic. 
- Automaticity directs attention to high-valued objects even when the current goal has changed. 
- Voluntary search on the other hand is much slower and involves evaluating objects serially by comparing items in capacity limited working memory. 
- Object skill is mediated by a restricted part of the basal ganglia: the tail of the caudate nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. These regions in turn  send information to superior colliculus (if the outcome or behavioral response is a saccade.)
## other notes
- Hikosaka et al also endorse two-system theory as a lot of others do. They do so because highly skilled and automatized responses are not sensitive to more recent changes in the stimulus and its value. A slower and more deliberate second system that is sensitive to recent changes is needed. 
- Perhaps reading the Zola paper on Declarative and Non-declarative memories might be useful
