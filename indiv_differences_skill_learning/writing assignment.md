1) Anderson asserts that skill learning involves interpreting declarative information about how to perform a task into production rules that are higher-level abstractions. 
2) Anderson et al 1999 say that intuitions are formed from explicit examples on how to solve specific problems. Additionally, In this study, they observed that learners use a mixture of strategies through out a problem solving or learning session- directly recalling responses to problems, analogical extrapolation of a solution by recalling a similar example, using a declarative rule, and using a procedural rule. 
3) Observations from studies about programming language learning seem to align with the above declarative to procedural knowledge.
