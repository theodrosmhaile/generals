# Schneider and Chein (2003) Controlled and automatic processing
This is a review paper. 
## Research Question:
Presents a summary of the controlled vs automatic processing and suggests some biological mechanisms that may underlie this dual processing point of view. 
## Approach

## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- **Automatic processes** are responses or behaviors that are deployed automatically without active control given the right input. S &S (1997) define this as the automatic activation of a series of ‘nodes’ [in memory]. 
	- Sufficient training is required to activate these nodes in such an automatic fashion. 
	- These networks of nodes are very stable. Automatic processes are not mentally taxing and are resistant to stressor and distractors.
	- Automatic processes therefore behave much like most connectionist networks (after they have been trained).
- **controlled processes** are activations of more temporary sequences of nodes through attentional, active control of the subject. 
	- These are capacity limited but there are large benefits where these fast flexible networks could be organized and activated to learn and perform actions quickly for situations where automatic processes have not been learned. 
	- Learning can be passed on to others by instruction or observation that may be available to use immediately. 
	- Accordingly, controlled processing proceeds similarly to processing in most production system architectures. This is very confusing.
	- Can attend to and act up on a temporarily relevant stimulus. *This sounds like new declarative information or new goals are acted up on domain general procedures?*
	- _Learning in this case, with a varied mapping trial does not occur_. Controlled processes are reported to be effortful, and affected by distractions and stressors. 
	- Automatic vs controlled processing 
- **Functional Anatomy of controlled and Automatic processing:** 
	- This paper speculates which brain regions are related to controlled and automatic processes through the CAP2 architecture. 
	- They liken the control system of CAP2 which is more active during the beginning parts of learning a skill, then perhaps, flexible controlled processing to posterior parietal, thalamus, anterior cingulate, occipito-temporal, bilateral medial pfc, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This all sounds like WM, attention executive control processing. Not sure yet how this fits into Miller, Hikosaka et al framework of associations being learned rapirdly and initially through BG?

	- The PPC is mapped to attentional control
	- DLPFC is mapped to goal maintenance and wm?
	- ACC monitors activity and interrupts automatic processes when they are error prone and also inhibiting inappropriate behaviors or unsuccessful ones. ACC resolves conflict between task demands and habitual responses
	- Episodic store Hippocampus and MTL
