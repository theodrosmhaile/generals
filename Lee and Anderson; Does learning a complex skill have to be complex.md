# Lee and Anderson; Does learning a complex skill have to be complex?
## Research Question:
Can we have a more complete characterization of complex tasks with learning theories?
Learning at the global level reflects the learning of lower level task components. 
## Approach
Analyze behavioral data on the Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task with additional eye-tracking characterization. 
1. Decompose hierarchically the KA-ATC task from the global task level to smaller component skills like keystrokes. 
	2. Improvement at the higher level should be consistent with the lower level. 
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- performance in simple tasks don’t scale-up to complex tasks
- Learning at the global level reflects the learning of lower level task components. 
- learning in the KA-ATC task is driven by changes in attentional strategies which prioritize task-relevant information and de-prioritize task irrelevant information through practice. 
- Power Law of Practice: _T= A + B N^-c_ where A= asymptote, B=amount of time that improves with N practice sessions and C is the rate of the increase of the speedup with practice. Why is there a dramatic deccelaration  in latency with increase in practice as fit well by the power function?
- The authors suggested that the global level power law learning reflects a mixture of attentional strategies that are learned at the lower level. Lower level here probably means finding targets on screen very efficiently and finding response keys efficiently. 
- Skill Acquisition theories:
	- **Acquisition as transforming a procedure:** Here, multi-step procedures collapse in to macro-procedures that are characterized by a power law learning function increase in speedup with practice. This is because red highlights page 4. 
		- _Neves and Anderson (1981)_ proposed a knowledge compilation theory. 1) Declarative knowledge is  proceduralized and 2) Macro procedures are formed when multistep procedures are collapsed. 
	- **Acquisition as strengthening a procedure:** According to _Anderson (1982)_ power laws of complex tasks are made of power laws of simple tasks. In simple tasks, individual steps are _strengthened_ instead of collapse of multistep processes since these do not exist in simple tasks. 
		- _MacKay_ on the other hand suggested that knowledge is an hierarchical organization of information. E.g. Sentences are supra-ordinate to verb and noun phrases. Verb and noun phrases are in turn supra-ordinate to other nodes that represent syllables. Priming mechanisms speeded the responsiveness of the other nodes at the same level. AS above, the decreased number of opportunities for learning because of the reduction in the available number of unpracticed nodes the learning curve becomes a power law, reduced from an exponential function 
	-  **Acquisition as selecting a procedure:** _Crossman (1959)_ and, later,  _Logan (1988)_ posited that the speedup is associated with selecting a faster method of performing the task during learning. These methods are perhaps different memory retrievals vs algorithmic process. Power function speed up is observed because there is an increasing number of methods that race in parallel with practice. The fastest method is then selected. _Rickard (1997)_ argues that this has to happen serially, not in parallel, and the speedup is due to a change in the strategy. 
- **Reducibility Hypothesis** states that complex tasks are simply made up of smaller components that are governed by basic learning principles. It is not clear if these learning principles are declarative vs procedural.
