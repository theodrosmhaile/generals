# Anderson: Acquisition of memories. 
This is a book chapter

## Research Question
How do we form memories? What influences better memory?
## Approach
Review of early memory studies
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- **power law of learning**: a curvilinear power function defines all learning connecting days or time of practice and accuracy or speed up. The power law function shows that there is diminishing benefits of practice. 
- LTP is also a power function. Increasing frequency of Stimulation of a neuron results in higher excitatory post synaptic potential. So neural and behavioral representations of memory seem to be power functions.
- Memory seems to make available information that is relevant or represents information that is highly probable to occur again in the environment. This is perhaps because probability of occurrence in the environment is also a power function
- Memory is stored across cortex in regions that process the specific type of information. E.g. language items in language areas, objects in visual areas
- Memories are stored in chunks of about 3 items
- Karlin and Dueck 1975: droodles!: subjects remember most the meaningful interpretation of the image rather than details. This is interesting and perhaps contrasts or simply enhances the BG-PFC point of view of skill learning. In the latter, declarative information is needed only until the skill is proceduralized. In that sense, all skills start out with laborious application of declarative information. Better representations of information in declarative memory make this information more easily available for use in skill performance.
