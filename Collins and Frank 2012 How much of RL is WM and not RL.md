# Collins and Frank 2012 How much of RL is WM and not RL?

## Research Question:
What are the contributions of WM and RL to simple instrumental learning?  Can we isolate these contributions using hybrid models?
## Approach
- cognitive models: RL and WM hybrid model
- Simple association learning tasks
- verification of model estimates with genetic markers of prefrontal WM and RL
## Findings
 - The effect of delay on performance decreased with more training. 
- As set sizes increased learners likely relied on reinforcement learning. *Why? Why not use RL to begin with? It is likely that some learners shift to RL early on or use declarative memory enhancing strategies like creating meaning to remember the associations.  How is the BG connected to hippocampus and declarative information learning? According to Miller rules are learned by PFC for categorizing stimuli which is declarative learning?*
- Does BG RL train declarative memory learning? 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- Attentional lapses?
### Highlights
Yellow - points to note/important 
Red - questions/discrepancies/disagree/donâ€™t understand
Green - connects well with other recognized
