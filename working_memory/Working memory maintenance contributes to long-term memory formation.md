# Working memory maintenance contributes to long-term memory formation

## Research Question
does WM maintenance affect LTM storage?
## Approach
In two experiments, the researchers ask if disrupting early or late stage WM maintenance impairs LTM and if items that were successfully maintained during early or late-stage WM are better remembered than items that were not maintained.  They used event locked fMRI to look at PFC and MTL regions. 
## Findings
 - Hippocampal activity during the early stage of wm maintenance, where sensory items are actively rehearsed in WM, was linked to successful LTM formation. 
- Interferance in early in WM maintenance was disruptive of LTM but not in the middle or late phases of maintenance
- MTL also contributes to WM
- ventrolateral PFC may be involved in LTM formation by facilitating the selection and maintenance of relevant item features
