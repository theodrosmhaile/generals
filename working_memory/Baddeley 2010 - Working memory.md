# Baddeley 2010 - Working memory

# 
This is a review paper. 

# Summary
- The phonological loop sub-system might share cortical areas with language production areas (temporal lobe? broca’s area). Poor working memory coincides with poor language acquisition. Interesting that we probably will not find an impairment in programming language learning? Not sure. 
- Baddeley’s 3-component model is not vastly different from Cowan’s virtually single component, attention dependent model. Cowan suggests that chunks in long-term memory are activated and maintained by directing attentional resources directed by a central executive.
