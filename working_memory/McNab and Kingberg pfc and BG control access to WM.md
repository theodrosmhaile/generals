# McNab and Kingberg pfc and BG control access to WM
# Question
What are the neural determinants of control of selection of items that go into wm? Where is WM represented in the brain?
# Approach 
An fMRI study to find how gating is performed to stop unnecessary information from being help in working memory. 

# Findings
- The PFC is activated before items are stored in wm and acts as a control center that decides which features are relevant.
- They found that the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia controls the thalamo-cortical pathways that prevent or allow information to parietal/pfc regions. They showed that there was an increase in unnecessary information that was correlated with a decrease in globus pallidus activity. Furthermore, basal ganglia activity works to stablize select relevant memories against distraction. Recall that Cowan has said that new information is usually a re-organized or recombined set of already known information in LTM. But this new pattern is recorded to LTM as new memories. It is perhaps prudent to think about and remember that it is likely that items in working memory live in parietal-temporal-occipital regions depending on the nature of the items. For example, visual items might live in parietal regions and auditory items in temporal regions.
- The two systems, PFC and BG, work in concert to filter and give stimuli access to working memory. 

# Summary and how does it connect
Mcnabâ€™s paper and findings seem to align with the concept of wm capacity limitations that arise from an inability to limit distracting information which aligns more with the attention modulation concept of working memory function that is championed by Cowan.
