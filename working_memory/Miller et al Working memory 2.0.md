# Miller et al Working memory 2.0

## Research Question:
Neuronal communication is more complex that simple persistent firing and activity related spikes in frequency. Analysis of LFP shows that persistence of spiking might just be a phenomenon of averaging activities of single neurons. The real story might just be that something like WM maintenance and gating of sensory information which grants access to WM might be the result of interactions among Alpha, beta, gamma, and theta oscillations.

## summary and how does it connect
- The gamma band (30-100Hz) is associated with sensory information held in WM
- Gamma power correlates with the amount of items in WM. 
- There are sparse coordinated firing of neurons in a local population. 
- Spiking and short-term plasticity are thought to be mechanisms for short term memory. Plasticity here is described as synaptic weight changing. 
- Gamma bursts and brief spiking refresh synaptic weights for maintenance of memory  beyond the timeline of short-term plasticity or synaptic weight changes. 
- If there are more items to remember in working memory, there is a proportional increase in gamma bursts to refresh the network.
- Gamma bursts occur during  delays but less so and tend to occur towards the end of the delay where information needs to be retrieved. 
- Alpha and beta are anti correlated with gamma. 
	- An increase in gamma is associated with allowing in  sensory information and maintenance in WM. This coincides with a decrease in Alpha and Beta. 
	- If Alpha and Beta are increased, there is a related decrease in gamma activity which suggests clearing of WM contents. 
- Alpha and Beta activity is associated with inhibition. Different cortical areas express inhibition at different frequencies: In visual cortex inhibition is seen at frequencies in the alpha range whereas in pfc, inhibitions largely occur in the frequency range closer to Beta. An exception to this is in the parietal cortex where low-band Beta is associated with working memory maintenance. 
- Alpha/Beta may aid in protecting working memory from distraction. 
	- Patterns of beta synchrony between visual cortex and PFC occur during goal maintenance (top-down inhibition).
	- There is increased gamma for task-relevant items that attention is being directed to which is coupled with increased alpha and beta to task irrelevant information. 
	- Sensory enhancement of stimuli as through attention enhances gamma.
