## Approach

## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- **Attentional modulations of sensory encoding**
	- Several EEG, PET and fMRI in humans, and single unit recording experiments have provided evidence for attentional modulation or enhancement of attended stimuli in visual cortex as early as 60 ms in primates and 100 ms in humans. 
	- timing and the localization of attentional modulations provide a strong indication that attention influences some of the earliest stages of perceptual analysis.
- **Attention as a “gatekeeper” for working memory**
	- Attentional blink provides a possible evidence for capacity limitations of wm. While the initial sensory encoding of the second stimulus in the attentional blink task is successful the post sensory (perceptual representation) enhancement fails to grant access to WM for encoding is one interpretation of this data. 
	- Another interpretation relies on the fact that the attentional blink effect is observed only when participants are instructed to attend to both stimuli. In this case, the limitation is likey due to an attentional bottleneck and not working memory. Other studies also somewhat support this point of view because highly relevant infomration like the subject’s name is immune to the AB effect. 
	- ERP studies provide one demonstration of how attention can operate at a relatively late stage of processing, to determine which stimuli will gain access to working memory after the completion of early perceptual and semantic processing. 
	- ** Attentional selection within working memory**
		- The integrity of representations within working memory was determined by internal shifts of attention towards one object or the other. So direction of attention to things within wm…
- **Attention-based rehearsal in working memory**
