## Summary
- Working memory is more easily recognized as short term storage or maintenance of information but WM is also where information is manipulated.
- PFC is probably the seat of the executive control that is the working part of working memory. In a simple rule learning task, the rule and not the sensory information drives a larger activity in PFC.
- Cognitively demanding tasks recruit 30-40% of PFC neurons
- PFC represents rules as rule maps that contain the network required to complete the task. These are pathways within and between the relevant regions.
- Teaching by reward through DOPAMINE. Dopamine neurons fire to the earliest predictor of a reward in a chain of actions.
- There is a large projection of DA neurons to PFC but the projections to the Striatum  are larger. This maybe why we see a larger effect of training via DA on the Striatum rather than the PFC where the effect is more moderate. This might also explain why the Striatum is more readily activated than PFC during learning
- If BG learns the pieces of the puzzle then PFC assembles the puzzle. PFC creates hierarchically higher rules out of the smaller and many associations learned by the BG.
- The closed loop BG-PFC connections suggest a recursive computations where new associations are added on to older concepts and built out to be more complex.
