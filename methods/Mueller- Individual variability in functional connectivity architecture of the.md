# Mueller: Individual variability in functional connectivity  architecture of the human brain.

## Research Question:
Assessing the spatial distribution of inter-subject connectivity variability and how it relates to individual differences in cognition and behavior. 
## Approach
- Resting-state connectivity data was collected on 23 subjects, scanned 5 times. Meta-analysis. 
- Yeo 7 network connectivity analysis

## Findings
- Higher variability was observed in FPN, followed by vATN, DN, dATN, and low variability across subjects in LMB, Mot and and Vis. — meaning non-uniform distribution of variability across the brain. 
- Functional connectivity variability distribution was highly correlated with evolutionary cortical surface expansion. 
- Brain folding patterns are highly variable in lateral frontal and parietal areas; less so in motor, vision etc. 
\- 
## Limitations
- Limitations for connectivity analyses apply.

## summary and how does it connect

### Highlights
Yellow - points to note/important 
Red - questions/discrepancies/disagree/don’t understand
Green - connects well with other recognized
