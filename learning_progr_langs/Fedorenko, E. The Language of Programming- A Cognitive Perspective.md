Fedorenko, E., Ivanova, A., Dhamala, R., & Bers, M. U. (2019). The Language of Programming: A Cognitive Perspective. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 23(7), 525–528. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.04.010


## Research Question:
What are the cognitive mechanisms and corresponding brain circuits that support learning and use of prog Langs?
Which learning/memory mechanism are required?
## Approach
Review paper
## Findings
  comp science language is becoming integral.
- Comp languages are similar to natural languages but the cognitive underpinnings and their links have not been extensively evaluated. 
	- both CL and NL rely on building blocks and a set of constraints for how the building blocks are combined to create complex meaning.
- multistep processing pipeline:
	- comprehension: what do the words/lines of code mean?
	- generating: think, plan and write/speak. 
	- predictive processing: constraints and simulation of the direction the code might be taking. 
	- Finding errors and creative building of code are parts of this process. 

## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
This is a review paper that establishes the necessity and plausibility of understanding computer programming languages from the point of view of  natural languages. 


### Highlights
Yellow - points to note/important 
Red - questions/discrepancies/disagree/don’t understand
Green - connects well with other recognized
