# Lye and Koh 2014 Review on teaching and learning of computational thinking
## Research Question:
What are the computational thinking outcomes that could result from K-12 programming education?
- *Coupled with Federenko this is another good paper to scaffold programming language skills. It can be interpreted easily into declarative and procedural skills*
- *How is reducing cognitive load useful for teaching programming?*
## Approach
This is a review of the literature. 
## Findings
 
## Limitations

## summary
- computational thinking is the use of computer science concepts like abstraction, debugging remixing, and iteration to solve problems. 
	- further broken down into *concepts* - knowledge of programming items like ‘variables’, *practices*- the process of programming and problem solving, and *perspectives* - learners’ understanding of themselves, others and techonology (very vague).
- The paper distinguishes programming and computational concepts like logic and structure and problem solving, and programming syntax. They argue that languages that are closer to human languages allows for focusing on teaching concepts instead of difficult language-specific syntax. This might represent the difficulty associated with older and traditional programming languages like C++. 
- Beyound enabiling students to focus on programming concepts and reduce cognitve load by eliminating difficult syntax, such languages, like scratch and Alice also allow them to see the outcomes of their code in ways that are easier to interpret. in other words, feedback is immediately meaningful.

- incremental and iterative problem solving skills are vital? *Reflecting* on work done helped with learning; 
- Reducing cognitive load helped learning
- constructionism
