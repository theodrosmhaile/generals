# Mayer 1981 the psychology of how novices learn programming languages.
- *Great point about the declarative knowledge and problem solving dimensions to programming*
- *Large amount of domain knowledge is required*
- *As with Lye and Koh, relieving cognitive load helps by meaningfully chunking information, another indicator of expert performance (inspired by chess masters example)*
	- *This connects well with the consolidation point of view from Anderson and ACT-R*
- *As with Mayer, 1981, there seems to be value in schemas. Experts might have larger schemas they can integrate information into so, learning new material is easier and walking down an existing cognitive map is easier and requires less problem solving because solutions might be simply recalled and modified easily to fit new situations. Seemingly, in addition to a repertoire of functions and operators, schemas for solutions to common problems makes it easier. It is difficult to say how this information is represented - is it all declarative, is it all procedural, a model-based state, or a combination of the two?*

## Research Question:
what have we learned about how to increase the students’ understanding of computer programming?
The goal is to understand methods that facilitate the integration of new information into an already existing schema of knowledge for students’ better understanding. 
## Approach

## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
- **Meaningful learning:** connecting new material with knowledge that already exists, a process called assimilation. This is the integration of new information into a *schema*.
- **Understanding** is the ability to use learned information in problem-solving a previously unseen problem/task; essentially, *transfering* learning to new situations.  This maybe similar to Anderson’s interpretation stage of declarative information to be used in procedures. 
- **Concrete learning model**: used concrete objects like sticks to explain and teach math concepts and an operation algorithm. Students who recieved this model of learning performed better, on more complicated problems, than those who were given declarative information along with practice with numbers. Why does this difference occur? Abstractive thought is difficult; perhaps the concrete method allows for less abstraction of concepts. 
- **Advance organizing information** -  perhaps could more subtly be described as priming- helps with integrating new information and also with better transfer to more complicated problems. This could be why it is useful to have introductory paragraphs with clear and organizing topic statements. 
- **Elaboration** describing program statements in one’s own words helps with understanding.
