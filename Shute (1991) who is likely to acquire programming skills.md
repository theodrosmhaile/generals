# Shute (1991) who is likely to acquire programming skills?

## Research Question:
- What is the relationship between programming skill acquisition and various measures of individual differences?
- Could programming language acquisition success be predicted from measures of general problem-solving abilities? These involve, _understanding_, _method-finding_ and _coding_.
- What  are the contributions of learning style behaviors like asking for hints?
## Approach
- Cognitive battery was administered. e.g. :
	-  vocab and math skill. 
	- working memory capacity and information processing speed in quantitative, verbal and spatial domains. 
- Algebra word problems to test the problem-solving abilities. 
- cognitive abilities were regressed/paritialed out to measure contributions of problem-solving abilities only. 
- Programming language learning was done/tested by the Pascal programming intelligent tutoring system. 
	- 25 programming problems of increasing difficulty from printing out to terminal, simple for and while loops, and complex while loops. 
	- Three distinct learning phases: 
		1. produce natural language solutions
		2. extend above solutions into visual programming plans
		3. Write out plans as pascal code
- Learned programming skills were then tested with a post-test
	1. Detection of errors
	2. Decompose and order pascal commands into a problem solution
## Findings
-  Results from a factor analysis combining the ASVAB (general math, world, reasoning electronic knowledge) and LAMP (cognitive battery with WM and spatial  reasoning tasks) explained 57% of the variance. Factors include WM, General Knowledge, information processing speed, technical knowledge, and perceptual speed. 
- In an hierarchical regression analysis, where the 5 factors above were entered first, general knowledge accounted for 50% of the variance in the learning outcomes. Factor 5, perceptual speed was dropped from the analysis. 
- The two problem solving abilities, understanding and method-finding, added on to the 4 general knowledge predictors explained an additional 7 % (5.8 % by my calculation). Which is a significant increase. 
- Lastly, learning behavior like asking for hints etc explained 11% of the variance in programming learning outcome. 
- WM was the best predictor. Asking for hints was related to a decrease in skill performance but this relationship is complicated. Asking for a lot of hints in generally bad but it is worse if you don’t ask for hints and you made a lot of errors. 
## Limitations

## summary and how does it connect
general problem-solving abilities: 
- _understanding_: Understanding the parts or the basic elements of the problem
-  _method-finding_: decomposing and organizing the problem elements into a solution. 
- _coding_.: translating the natural language solution into programming language. 

An hierarchical regression was used to understand the relative contributions of general knowledge, cognitive abilities,  problem-solving ability, and learning behavior  to programming language learning. It was found that cognitive abilities and general knowledge/reasoning like working memory explained the most variance in programming language learning accounting for 50% of the variance. Learning behavior like asking for hints explained 11% of the variance and problem-solving ability explained about 7%. 

Working memory was the most predictive of learning behavior. WM strongly predicts both declarative and procedural learning. 
The design and implementation of the ITS emphasized higher-level organization and conceptualization of programming. This was also the most difficult bit for most students. This was perhaps why sequencing problem solving ability was a good predictor of learning outcome. Translating the natural language code in to pascal was relatively easy so Translation problem-solving ability was not predictive of learning outcome. 

## Other notes
- Decomposition of a task sort of links to Lee and Anderson (2001)
- I think it is very valuable to explore Philip Guo’s work with the python visualizer. This method was used as part of training in the pascal intelligent tutor. 
- How far will an animated visualizer go into building knowledge or understanding of programming? Does this provide efficient representations of programming problem spaces that may be resource sparing? Is this teaching a strategy? How does this help?
- This paper provides some actionable strategies for improving learning environments for students with varying cognitive abilities like providing smaller chunks of information for learners with a smaller WM capacity and providing or witholding help based on usability of the hint.
